# Member-Mixer
If you are an event planner for large organizations, Member Mixer can help you organize and plan distributed events, that help your membership meet new people at new locations.

If you are familiar with activities like "Dinners for 8", "Progressive Dinners", "Galloping Gourmet", etc., then this is the app for you!

This application allows you to easily:
* Auto-generate a event schedule, and adjust it anytime afterward
* Help members to communicate food restrictions/accessibility concerns, etc
* Account for "groups" of members who always travel/attend events together
* Keep a list of "alternates" or a "waiting list" that can be subbed in
* Create and send custom email notifications to participants
